# ## NAME
#
# dasht-query-exec - searches a [Dash] docset's SQLite3 database file
#
# ## SYNOPSIS
#
# `dasht-query-exec` *PATTERN* *DATABASE* [*OPTIONS\_FOR\_SQLITE3*...]
#
# ## DESCRIPTION
#
# Searches for *PATTERN* in *DATABASE*, which is an SQLite3 database file
# located inside a [Dash] docset at `/Contents/Resources/docSet.dsidx`, while
# passing the optional *OPTIONS\_FOR\_SQLITE3* arguments down to sqlite3(1).
#
# ### Searching
#
# SQL LIKE wildcard characters in *PATTERN* can be escaped with a backslash.
# For example, `\%` and `\_` are escaped, whereas `%` and `_` are not escaped.
