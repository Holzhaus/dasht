# Usage: dasht-query-line QUERY [DOCSET...]
#
# Searches for the given QUERY in Dash docsets whose names loosely match the
# given DOCSETs and prints the results in groups of four lines, in this order:
#
#     name = VALUE    # value of the token that matched the QUERY
#     type = VALUE    # type of the token, as defined in the docset
#     from = VALUE    # name of the docset this result was found in
#     url = VALUE     # URL of the API documentation for this result
#
# Whitespace characters in the given QUERY are treated as wildcards.
# Moreover, UNIX glob pattern syntax can be used in the given QUERY.
#
# Setup: $DASHT_DOCSETS_DIR
#
# This environment variable specifies where your Dash docsets are installed.
# If unspecified, its value is assumed to be $XDG_DATA_HOME/dasht/docsets/, or
# $HOME/.local/share/dasht/docsets/ if $XDG_DATA_HOME is also unspecified.
