.SH Version 2.2.0 (2017\-08\-15)
.PP
This release fixes the ability to install new docsets (which was broken since
July 2017 due to unannounced, incompatible upstream changes in docset hosting),
improves portability, search form usability, and saves space updating docsets.
.SS Minor:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
When a docset is updated, any obsolete files left behind by the previous
version of the docset's installation are now deleted to save disk space.

\fB\fCdasht\-server\fR: update styling for a more user\-friendly search form:

Make submit button as tall as the entire form so it's easy to hit.
.IP \(bu 2
Use monospace font throughout the form to enhance ilIO0o variance.
.IP \(bu 2
Shorten placeholder text to fit default width of popular browsers.

Historically, the sed ! and } editing commands did not permit multiple
commands on a single line using a semicolon as a command delimiter.
Implementations are permitted, but not required, to support this
extension.

.SH Version 2.1.0 (2016\-05\-28)
.PP
This release improves the feedback users and scripts get from dasht scripts,
fixes the ability to run dasht from non\-setpgid() environments like (Neo)Vim,
adds TAB completion for ZSH, and provides screencasts for prospective users.
.SS Minor:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
.BR dasht (1) 
now automatically opens the first search result if only one.
.IP \(bu 2
dasht\-query\-* scripts now exit with status 44 when no results found.
.IP \(bu 2
TAB completion for ZSH (see \fB\fCetc/zsh/\fR folder) for all dasht scripts.
.PP
Pressing TAB at the first argument completes \fB\fC\&''\fR and puts you on the
second argument, which is perfect for skipping the pattern altogether.
Pressing TAB at the second argument completes installed docset names.
.PP
Thanks to Tobias Mersmann (@tmerse) for suggesting this feature and
providing starter code at \[la]https://github.com/sunaku/dasht/issues/10\[ra]\&.

.BR dasht-server-http (1) 
now shows "no results found" message in browser.

.IP \(bu 2
.BR dasht-query-line (1) 
now sets default URI fragment for Erlang docset.
.PP
This affects modules, like the "dets" result in \fB\fCdasht dets erlang\fR\&.
.IP \(bu 2
.BR dasht-server-http (1) 
now opens search result links in the same window.
.PP
.BR w3m (1) 
opens search result links in the \fIsame\fP window, so don't make
the experience any different in browsers connected to 
.BR dasht-server (1).
.IP \(bu 2
.BR dasht (1) 
has revised pipefail emulation since Vim doesn't setpgid().
.PP
When \fB\fC:!dasht some_query_that_has_no_results_here\fR is run inside Vim,
the 
.BR w3m (1) 
instance still lives on, even though no results were found,
because the child processes of 
.BR dasht (1) 
don't inherit its pid as pgid.
.PP
That's why terminating all children with 
.BR kill (1) 
on pgid doesn't work.
Instead, the new strategy is to selectively kill 
.BR w3m (1) 
first and then
.BR dasht (1) 
to achieve the desired effect: no more 
.BR w3m (1) 
and nonzero exit.
.IP \(bu 2
.BR dasht (1) 
now avoids \fB\fC/bin/sh: line 1: Terminated\fR warning under BASH.
.PP
To ensure normal SIGTERM propagation to children, trap SIGUSR1 instead.

Revised "no results found" messages for HTML and text user interfaces.

.PP
This release improves the local search engine's responsiveness, usability, and
appearance (especially on small displays, like those found in mobile devices);
improves search term highlighting; and fixes escaping bugs and HTML5 validity.
.SS Major:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
.BR dasht-query-exec (1) 
now groups by first letter when nothing is searched.
.PP
This gives you a better overview of the breadth of available topics (A\-Z)
than the previous approach of simply returning the first 100 topics did.
.IP \(bu 2
.BR dasht-query-html (1) 
now wraps its HTML output, if any, in \fB\fC<table>\fR tags.
.PP
This moves the printing of HTML \fB\fC<table>\fR tags into 
.BR dasht-query-html (1)

and makes 
.BR dasht (1) 
run 
.BR w3m (1) 
eagerly, which provides visual feedback to
the user when a large HTML document is being read and buffered, and in
the case where no results are found: terminate with a message on stderr.
.RE
.SS Minor:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
.BR dasht-server-http (1) 
now streams search results to you as they are found.
.PP
Serve the HTML header and search form immediately\-\-\-before the search is
even performed\-\-\-so that the user instantly (and at the very least) sees
the search form in case they decide to abort the HTTP transfer partway.
.IP \(bu 2
.BR dasht-server-http (1) 
now provides a drop\-down menu for docset selection.
.PP
Drop the HTML5 \fB\fC<datalist>\fR because it can only suggest a single item, and
that too only when the text field is empty!  Instead, provide a \fB\fC<select>\fR
drop\-down menu from which the user can choose a single item and build up
multiple docset selections iteratively, with repeated form submissions.
.IP \(bu 2
.BR dasht-server-http (1) 
now word\-wraps search results to fit small displays.
.PP
Insert word\-break opportunity \fB\fC<wbr>\fR tags at the end of capitalized
words, runs of lowercase text, numbers, and punctuation marks to help the
browser fit search results to small displays, as found in mobile devices.

.BR dasht-server-http (1):

Bash and Docker docsets use the special "â€¦" ellipsis Unicode character.
.IP \(bu 2

Optimize search term highlighting and rework style.

When an empty pattern was given, useless empty highlights (bold and

Added

Docset tarballs downloaded by 
.BR dasht-docset-install (1) 
have no spaces in
their names, so use the same naming scheme for their extracted folders.

is now verbose when deleting files because large
docsets (like the Mono docset, sized at 7.6 GiB) take a while to delete.
