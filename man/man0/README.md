# dasht - API documentation in your terminal

dasht is a collection of shell scripts for searching, browsing, and managing
API documentation (provided by [Dash] in the form of [docsets] for numerous
languages, libraries, and tools) all from the comfort of your own terminal!

The name "dasht" is a portmanteau of [Dash] and the letter "t", for terminal.
Etymologically, "dasht" is Persian for _plain_, as in an flat expanse of land,
which aptly characterizes the terminal environment where everything is text.

## Installation

1.  Clone or [download] this Git repository onto your system.
[download]: https://github.com/sunaku/dasht/archive/master.zip

    Note: [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org) users may choose to install
    [this AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dasht-git/)
    maintained by [Christian HÃ¶ppner](https://github.com/mkaito).

2.  Add the `bin/` folder to your `$PATH` environment variable:

        export PATH=$PATH:location_where_you_cloned_or_downloaded_dasht/bin

## Configuration

### `$DASHT_DOCSETS_DIR`

This environment variable specifies where your [Dash] docsets are installed.
If unspecified, its value is assumed to be `$XDG_DATA_HOME/dasht/docsets/`, or
`$HOME/.local/share/dasht/docsets/` if `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is also unspecified.

## Usage

### Tutorial

First, install some [docsets] using dasht-docsets-install(1):

    dasht-docsets-install bash

Next, perform a direct search from the terminal using dasht(1):

    dasht 'c - x'

Then, repeat the search in a web browser using dasht-server(1):

    dasht-server

You are now ready to use dasht!  Read the manuals below to learn even more.

### Manuals

* You can browse the manuals online at <https://sunaku.github.io/dasht/man/>.

* If you installed dasht from your system's package manager, run `man dasht`.

* Else, run `man -M location_where_you_cloned_or_downloaded_dasht/man dasht`.

## Development

If you make changes to the embedded manual pages found in the comment headers
at the top of script files in the `bin/` directory, then remember to run the
`binman-rake` command afterward to regenerate UNIX manual pages for packaging.
