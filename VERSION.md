## Version 1.2.0 (2016-03-14)

### Minor:

  * Added dasht-docsets-extract(1) script for installing third-party docsets
    and for making sure extracted directory names match docset `*.tgz` files.

    Docset tarballs downloaded by dasht-docset-install(1) have no spaces in
    their names, so use the same naming scheme for their extracted folders.
    Thanks to Martijn Hoogendoorn (@mhoogendoorn) for reporting that such
    naming mismatches occur and for suggesting a potential fix in issue #5.

  * dasht-docsets-install(1) and dasht-docsets-remove(1) learned `--force`.

    The `xargs -p` prompt reads from `/dev/tty` so it's not easy to automate.

  * dasht-docsets-remove(1) is now verbose when deleting files because large
    docsets (like the Mono docset, sized at 7.6 GiB) take a while to delete.

  * dasht-query-line(1) now adds default URI fragments to search result URLs,
    letting you skip past the mess of navigation links atop these 138 docsets:

  * dasht(1) now sets w3m(1) options to make find-on-page more forgiving.

### Patch:

  * dasht-query-exec(1): Guides in C++ docset have 0-length zanchor values.

    This produced URLs with a stray "#" URI fragment separator at the end,
    which in turn broke w3m(1)'s ability to follow links in search results.

  * dasht-query-exec(1): sqlite 3.7.9 wants options _before_ arguments.

    Thanks to @joshpy for reporting this in issue #3 and suggesting the fix.

  * dasht-docsets-install(1): fix gotcha in shell short-circuit evaluation.

    Thanks to Edgar Hipp (@netei) for reporting and fixing this in issue #6.

  * dasht-docsets-install(1) is now visibly faster to install large docsets.

    Don't bother checking whether the docset archive is corrupt or partially
    downloaded because tar(1) will subsequently fail under such cases anyway.

  * dasht-server-http(1): Search form obscured results in mobile browsers.

  * dasht-server-http(1): Bold effect on hover slowed graphical browsers.

## Version 1.1.0 (2016-02-28)

This release adds UNIX manpages, improves the UI, and fixes MacOSX support.

### Minor:

  * Add "[y/N]" hint to xargs confirmation prompt.  Thanks to [Christian
    HÃ¶ppner]( https://github.com/mkaito ) for suggesting this improvement.

  * Add UNIX manual pages for all scripts, generated using [binman](
    https://sunaku.github.io/binman ).

### Patch:

  * sed(1), awk(1), et. al. differ in curious ways under MacOSX.  Thanks to
    [Alaric Holloway]( https://github.com/skedastik ) and [Kareem Gan](
    https://github.com/magicalbanana ) for reporting bugs and testing fixes.
